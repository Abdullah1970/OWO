# ðŸ”§ Discord Token Fix Guide for Hosting

## The Problem
Your Discord token is getting a 403 "Missing or invalid Authorization header" error on hosting platforms, even though it works locally.

## Root Cause
Discord has stricter validation for tokens accessed from hosting/VPS IP addresses. Your current token may be flagged or restricted.

## Solution: Get a Fresh Token

### Method 1: Browser Developer Tools (Recommended)
1. **Open Discord in a fresh browser session**
2. **Clear all Discord cookies/cache first**
3. **Log in to Discord completely fresh**
4. **Press F12 â†’ Network tab**
5. **Send any message in Discord**
6. **Find the request to `/api/v*/channels/*/messages`**
7. **Copy the Authorization header value**

### Method 2: Discord Developer Console
1. **Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications**
2. **Create a new application**
3. **Go to Bot section**
4. **Create a bot and copy the token**
5. **Note: This creates a bot token, not a user token**

## Token Format Check
Your token should:
- Be 70+ characters long
- Start with letters/numbers (user tokens)
- NOT have "Bot " prefix (that's for bot tokens)

## Hosting Platform Setup

### For Kata Dump:
```bash
# Replace YOUR_NEW_TOKEN with the fresh token
# Update your config.json with the new token
{
  "user_token": "YOUR_NEW_TOKEN_HERE"
}
```

### Environment Variables (Alternative):
```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_NEW_TOKEN_HERE
CHANNELS=1412304902407061615,1405205020114292768
```

## Why This Happens
- Discord detects hosting/VPS IP addresses
- Tokens extracted from browsers may have session restrictions
- Some tokens are tied to specific IP ranges
- Account security flags can block hosting environments

## Testing Your New Token
The bot will automatically test your token and show:
```
âœ… Token valid for user: YourUsername#1234
```

Or specific error messages if there are still issues.

## If Problems Persist
1. **Try a different Discord account**
2. **Use a bot token instead of user token**
3. **Contact hosting support about IP restrictions**
4. **Try a different hosting platform**

## Important Notes
- User tokens violate Discord ToS (use at your own risk)
- Bot tokens are officially supported but have different permissions
- Some hosting platforms block Discord API access entirely
